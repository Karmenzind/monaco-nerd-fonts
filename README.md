Terminal-friendly monaco font, with extra nerd glyphs, [patched](./build.sh) with [ryanoasis's nerd patcher](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts#font-patcher).

Build commands are in [build.sh](./build.sh).

### Updates

- 2023-05-30: [Merged](https://github.com/Karmenzind/monaco-nerd-fonts/pull/9) new 3.0.0 version. (thanks to @hjdarnel)
- 2022-10-18: Nerd-fonts repo had [fixed the 'fl' bug](https://github.com/Karmenzind/monaco-nerd-fonts/issues/5#issuecomment-1280295129) (thanks to @Finii) so I patched new fonts. I don't know where to find the original source `otf` file or how to patch the patched font (it created fonts like `Monaco Nerd Font Complete Nerd Font Complete`, don't want to learn how to fix it). The new font are patched based on [this ttf file](https://www.fontmirror.com/monaco). For now it seems pretty good.
- 2019-03-18: Updating freetype2 to version `2.10.*` might break the font on Archlinux. To fix it, check https://github.com/Karmenzind/monaco-nerd-fonts/issues/2 (thanks to @guihkx). I'll update the font file at my leisure time.
